      <div class="text-block">
        <p>
          As an international company with Users worldwide, Mered may transfer
          and access personal information around the world, including to and
          from the European Economic Area. To comply with applicable laws and
          regulations, Mered maintains strong data protection and privacy
          controls to protect Users' personal information during cross-border
          and international transfers, as well as during periods of storage in
          foreign countries.<br /><br />
          Mered believes that the User's essential privacy rights are not
          contingent on his/her nationality or residency. While applicable laws
          always govern data privacy matters, Mered intends for this Privacy
          Policy to apply generally to Users and their personal information
          around the world. Nevertheless, privacy laws and regulations are a
          constantly changing landscape, so Mered reserves the right to deviate
          from this Privacy Policy where applicable law provides for a different
          approach.

      <div class="text-block">
        <p>
          Mered will only keep personal information for as long as it is
          necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy unless a
          longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
          accounting, or other legal requirements).<br /><br />
          When Mered has no ongoing legitimate business need to process the
          personal information of the User, the Company will either delete or
          anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because
          personal information has been stored in backup archives), then Mered
          will securely store personal data and isolate it from any further
          processing until deletion is possible.

        <p>
          Mered aims to protect Users' personal information through a system of
          organizational and technical security measures.<br /><br />
          Mered has implemented appropriate technical and organizational
          security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
          information the Company processes. However, Users also should remember
          that Mered cannot guarantee that the Internet itself is 100% secure.
          Although the Company will do its best to protect personal information,
          the transmission of personal information to and from Mered website is
          at the User own risk. Users should only access the services within a
          secure environment.
